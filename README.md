**The problem ChatCode solves**
- How do you plan to code with your coding buddies?

- You may use discord, g-meet, MS-teams, etc to join audio and maybe share your screen to show your code to the others.

**What's wrong with that?**
- Your friends can not modify or run the code you guys are working on.
- Sharing your entire screen requires a higher bandwidth internet connection for a smooth experience.
- How would you like a platform where every one of your squad can modify the code while joined with audio to discuss it all?
- Our team "Fantastic4" is here with "ChatCode", where you can chat with your friends while talking to them.

**Features of ChatCode :**
- Create different rooms
- Join voice-chat with everyone in the room
- Everyone in the room can modify and run the code
- Users can join multiple rooms
- Password security for entering into any room so unauthorized person can not join your room
- Editor window supports multiple themes and font sizes
- Users can run the code written in different programming languages

**Challenges we ran into**
- The first challenge was to implement an online judging system.
- To implement a shared code editor where everyone can modify the code and see the changes in real-time.

* Technologies we used
-Node.js, Next.js, Socket.IO, TypeScript, MongoDB
